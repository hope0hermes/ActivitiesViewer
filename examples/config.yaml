# ActivitiesViewer Configuration Example
# Copy this file to your project directory and update paths and settings

# --- Data Directory Configuration ---
# Path to the directory containing activities data
# Can be absolute or relative to this config file
data_dir: "../dev/data_enriched"

# New dual-file format (StravaAnalyzer v2.0+)
# Filename of raw activities CSV - all data points (relative to data_dir)
activities_raw_file: "activities_raw.csv"

# Filename of moving activities CSV - motion-only data (relative to data_dir)
activities_moving_file: "activities_moving.csv"

# Legacy single-file format (for backward compatibility, optional)

# --- Athlete Configuration ---
# Your Functional Threshold Power in watts
ftp: 285.0

# Your body weight in kilograms
weight_kg: 77.0

# Your maximum heart rate in bpm
max_hr: 185

# --- Critical Power Model (Computed Automatically) ---
# CP and W' are computed from your power curve data using a 90-day rolling window
# These values are stored in the activities CSV and updated as you add new data
# You don't need to configure them here - they come from data analysis
#
# For reference:
# - CP (Critical Power): Sustainable power for extended efforts (~85-90% FTP)
# - W' (W-prime): Anaerobic work capacity above CP (~15-30 kJ typical range)
# - Both metrics evolve with your fitness and are tracked over time

# --- Goal Tracking (Optional) ---
# Set a W/kg improvement goal to track your progress
# Uncomment and configure these fields to enable goal tracking on home page
